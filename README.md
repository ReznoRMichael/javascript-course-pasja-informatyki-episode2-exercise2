> Training course - Pasja Informatyki, JavaScript course, episode 2 ( [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJKXlxn9e-g) )

## General info
The basics of JavaScript. In this exercise a user inputs two numbers into two fields. The script reads the values entered in each. If the number on the left is smaller than on the right, the script will display all the numbers from lowest to highest separated by a new line on the screen. If the number on the left is bigger than on the right, the script will display all the numbers from highest to lowest separated by a new line on the screen. If the numbers are identical or the user didn't input anything the script will display an appriopriate message.
